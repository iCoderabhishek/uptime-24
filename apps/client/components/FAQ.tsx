    question: "How does community-verified uptime work?",
    answer:
      "Instead of relying on a single server to determine uptime, we crowdsource real-time responses from global validators. This ensures a decentralized, tamper-resistant uptime status.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my website safe while being monitored?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We only ping your site using standard HTTP requests and do not store or interact with your site data or authentication layers.",
  },
  {
    question: "How often is uptime checked?",
    answer:
      "Free tier checks every 5 minutes. Validators may ping more frequently based on load. Premium plans offer faster checks and logs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I become a validator?",
    answer:
      "Yes! You can run our lightweight open-source script and start validating uptime checks while earning reputation points.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to sign in to monitor a site?",
    answer:
      "No. You can anonymously monitor up to 3 websites. For advanced features like email alerts, logs, and team access, youâ€™ll need to sign in.",
