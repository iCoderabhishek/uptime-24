# ⏱️ Uptime24

**Decentralized uptime monitoring** powered by web3. Instead of relying on a single server, Uptime24 lets real users validate whether a site is **up or down**. The status is determined by community consensus.

##  Features

* **Crowdsourced validation** – users confirm if a site is up/down.
* **Consensus-based status** – avoids false positives.
* **Web-only frontend** – simple and lightweight.
*  **Web3 integration** – validations are stored transparently.
